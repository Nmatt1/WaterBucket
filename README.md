WaterBucket Data Pack for Minecraft Java Edition


### About

WaterBucket is a survival rebalance and quality-of-life data pack for Minecraft Java Edition. It can be added or removed to worlds without breaking anything. Changes are primarily to loot tables and recipes. WaterBucket adds no new blocks, textures, sounds, or entities. Refer to [features.md](https://github.com/Valafar123/WaterBucket/blob/master/features.md) for list of features, and [changelog.md](https://github.com/Valafar123/WaterBucket/blob/master/changelog.md) for list of changes from previous versions.


### Install Instructions

Move the `WaterBucket` folder from this repository to the `datapacks` folder in your desired world save folder and type `/reload` - on a modded server (Bukkit/Spigot/Paper and likewise) you may have to type `/minecraft:reload`.
